# glossRy

A small glossary of terms used in R and data science, designed for novices who
are still orienting themselves.  Contributions are very welcome: please see [the
contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to lend and hand,
and please note that all contributors must abide by our [Code of
Conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## Definitions

**Absolute path**: A path that points to the same location in the filesystem
  regardless of where it's evaluated. An absolute path is the equivalent of
  latitude and longitude in geography. See also *relative path*.

**Absolute row number**: the sequential index of a row in a table, regardless of
  what sections of the table is being displayed.

**Aggregation**: to combine many values into one, e.g., by summing a set of
  numbers or concatenating a set of strings.

**Aggregation function**: A function that combines many values into one, such as
  `sum` or `max`.

**Alias**: to have two or more references to the same physical data.

**Anonymous function**: a function that has not been assigned a name.  Anonymous
  functions are usually quite short, and are usually defined where they are
  used, e.g., as callbacks.

**Attribute**: a name-value pair associated with an object, used to store
  metadata about the object such as an array's dimensions.

**Base R**: FIXME

**Cascading Style Sheets**: A way to describe how HTML should be rendered.

**Catch** (an exception): to accept responsibility for handling an error or
  other unexpected event.  R prefers *handling* a *condition* to "catching an
  exception".

**Character encoding**: A specification of how characters are stored as
  bytes. The most commonly-used encoding today is *UTF-8*.

**Closure**: A set of variables defined in the same *scope* whose existence has
  been preserved after that scope has ended. Closures are one of the trickiest
  ideas in programming.

**Comma-Separated Values**: A text format for tabular data in which each record
  is one row and fields are separated by commas. There are many minor
  variations, particularly around quoting of strings.

**Condition**: an error or other unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow
  of control.  See also *handle*.

**Constructor** (of a class): a function that creates an object of a particular
  class.  In the *S3* object system, constructors are a convention rather than a
  requirement.

**Copy-on-modify**: the practice of creating a new copy of aliased* data
  *whenever there is an attempt to modify it so that each reference will believe
  *theirs is the only one.

**Data frame**: FIXME

**Double square brackets**: an index enclosed in `[[...]]`, used to return a
  single value of the underlying type.  See also *single square brackets*.

**Empty vector**: a vector that contains no elements.  Empty vectors have a type
  such as logical or character, and are *not* the same as *null*.

**Environment**: a structure that stores a set of variable names and the values
  they refer to.

**Escape sequence**: A sequence of characters used to represent some other
  character that would otherwise have a special meaning. For example, the escape
  sequence `\"` is used to represent a double-quote character inside a
  double-quoted string.

**Evaluation**: the process of taking a complex expression such as `1+2*3/4` and
  turning it into a single irreducible value.

**Exception**: An object that stores information about an error or other unusual
  event in a program. One part of a program will create and *throw* an exception
  to signal that something unexpected has happened; another part will *catch*
  it.

**Falsy**: A horrible neologism meaning "equivalent to false". See also the
  equally horrible *truthy*.

**Filter**: to choose a set of records according to the values they contain.

**Fully qualified name**: an unambiguous name of the form `package::thing`.

**Functional programming**: A style of programming in which data is transformed
  through successive application of functions, rather than by using control
  structures such as loops. Functional programming in R relies heavily on
  *higher-order functions*.

**Generic function**: a collection of functions with similar purpose, each
  operating on a different class of data.

**Global environment**: the *environment* that holds top-level definitions in R,
  e.g., those written directly in the interpreter.

**Global installation**: Installing a package in a location where it can be
  accessed by all users and projects. See also *local installation*.

**Global variable**: A variable defined outside any particular function, which
  is therefore visible to all functions. See also *local variable*.

**Group**: to divide data into subsets according to some criteria while leaving
  records in a single structure.

**GNU Public License**: A license that allows people to re-use software as long
  as they distribute the source of their changes.

**Handle** (a condition): to accept responsibility for handling an error or
  other unexpected event.  R prefers *handling a condition* to "catching an
  exception".

**Header row**: If present, the first of a *CSV* file that defines column names
  (but tragically, not their data types or units).

**Heterogeneous**: Having mixed type. For example, an *array* is said to be
  heterogeneous if it contains a mix of numbers, character strings, and values
  of other types. See also *homogeneous*.

**Higher-order function**: A function that operates on other functions. For
  example, the higher-order function `map` executes a given function once on
  each value in an *list*. Higher-order functions are heavily used in
  *functional programming*.

**Homogeneous**: Having a single type. For example, an *array* is said to be
  homogeneous if it contains only numbers or only character strings, but not a
  mix of the two.

**Hubris**: excessive pride or self-confidence.  See also *unit test* (lack of).

**Integrated Development Environment** (IDE): FIXME

**JSON**: A way to represent data by combining basic values like numbers and
  character strings in *arrays* and name/value structures. The acronym stands
  for "JavaScript Object Notation"; unlike better-defined standards like *XML*,
  it is unencumbered by a syntax for comments or ways to define *schemas*.

**Lazy evaluation**: delaying evaluation of an expression until the value is
  actually needed (or at least until after the point where it is first
  encountered).

**List**: a *vector* that can contain values of many different types.

**Local installation**: Placing a package inside a particular project so that it
  is only accessible within that project. See also *global installation*.

**Local variable**: A variable defined inside a function which is only visible
  within that function. See also *global variable* and *closure*.

**Logical indexing**: to index a vector or other structure with a vector of
  Booleans, keeping only the values that correspond to true values.

**Method**: an implementation of a *generic function* that handles objects of a
  specific class.

**MIT License**: A license that allows people to re-use software with no
  restrictions.

**Mutation**: Changing data in place, such as modifying an element of an array
  or adding a record to a database.

**NA**: a special value used to represent data that is Not Available.

**Name collision**: The ambiguity that arises when two or more things in a
  program that have the same name are active at the same time. The *call stack*
  and *fully-qualified names* were invented in part to solve this problem.

**Negative selection**: to specify the elements of a vector or other data
  structure that *aren't* desired by negating their indices.

**Non-standard evaluation**: see *lazy evaluation*.

**NoSQL database**: Any database that doesn't use the *relational* model.  The
  awkward name comes from the fact that such databases don't use *SQL* as a
  query language.

**Null**: a special value used to represent a missing object.  `NULL` is not the
  same as `NA`, and neither is the same as an *empty vector*.

**Package**: a collection of code, data, and documentation that can be
  distributed and re-used.

**Package manager**: A program that does its best to keep track of the bits and
  bobs of software installed on a computer.

**Parameter**: A variable whose value is passed into a function when the
  function is called. Some writers distinguish parameters (the variables) from
  *arguments* (the values passed in), but others use the terms in the opposite
  sense. It's all very confusing.

**Parse**: To translate the text of a program or web page into a data structure
  in memory that the program can then manipulate.

**Pipe operator**: the `%>%` used to make the output of one function the input
  of the next.

**Prefix operator**: FIXME

**Production code**: Software that is delivered to an end user. The term is used
  to distinguish such code from test code, deployment infrastructure, and
  everything else that programmers write along the way.

**Pseudo-random number**: A value generated in a repeatable way that has the
  properties of being truly random.

**Pseudo-random number generator**: A function that can generate a series of
  *pseudo-random numbers* after being initialized with a *seed*.

**Pull indexing**: vectorized indexing in which the value at location *i* in the
  index vector specifies which element of the source vector is being pulled into
  that location in the result vector, i.e., `result[i] = source[index[i]]`.  See
  also *push indexing*.

**Push indexing**: vectorized indexing in which the value at location *i* in the
  index vector specifies an element of the result vector that gets the
  corresponding element of the source vector, i.e., `result[index[i]] =
  source[i]`.  Push indexing can easily produce gaps and collisions.  See also
  *pull indexing*.

**Quosure**: a data structure containing an unevaluated expression and its
  environment.

**Quoting function**: a function that is passed expressions rather than the
  values of those expressions.

**R Markdown**: FIXME

**Raise**: To signal that something unexpected or unusual has happened in a
  program by creating an *exception* and handing it to the error-handling
  system, which then tries to find a point in the program that will *catch* it.

**Read-evaluate-print loop** (REPL): An interactive program that reads a command
  typed in by a user, executes it, prints the result, and then waits patiently
  for the next command. REPLs are often used to explore new ideas or for
  debugging.

**Recycle**: to re-use values from a shorter vector in order to generate a
  sequence of the same length as a longer one.

**Regular expression**: A pattern for matching text, written as text
  itself. Regular expressions are sometimes called "regexp", "regex", or "RE",
  and are as powerful as they are cryptic.  See [this documentation][re-doc]
  for more details.

**Relational database**: A database that organizes information into *tables*,
  each of which has a fixed set of named *fields* (shown as columns) and a
  variable number of *records* (shown as rows). See also *SQL*.

**Relative path**: A path whose destination is interpreted relative to some
  other location, such as the current directory. A relative path is the
  equivalent of giving directions using terms like "straight" and "left". See
  also *absolute path*.

**Relative row number**: the index of a row in a displayed portion of a table,
  which may or may not be the same as the *absolut row number* within the table.

**Repository**: FIXME

**Root directory**: The directory that contains everything else, directly or
  indirectly. The root directory is written `/` (a bare forward slash).

**S3**: a framework for object-oriented programming in R.

**Scalar**: a single value of a particular type, such as 1 or "a".  Scalars
  don't really exist in R; values that appear to be scalars are actually vectors
  of unit length.

**Scope**: The portion of a program within which a definition can be seen and
  used. See *global-variable*, *local-variable*, and *closure*.

**Script**: FIXME

**Seed**: A value used to initialize a *pseudo-random number generator*.

**Select**: to choose entire columns from a table by name or location.

**Signal** (a condition): a way of indicating that something has gone wrong in a
  program, or that some other unexpected event has occurred.  R prefers
  *signalling* a *condition* to "raising an exception".

**Single square brackets**: an index enclosed in `[...]`, used to select a
  structure from another structure.  See also *double square brackets*.

**SQL**: The language used for writing queries for *relational databases*. The
  term was originally an acronym for Structured Query Language.

**String**: A block of text in a program. The term is short for "character
  string".

**String interpolation**: The process of inserting text corresponding to
  specified values into a string, usually to make output human-readable.

**Table**: A set of uniformly-formatted *records* in a *relational database*.
  Tables are usually drawn with rows (each of which represents one record) and
  columns (each of which represents a *field*).

**Tibble**: a modern replacement for R's data frame, which stores tabular data
  in columns and rows, defined and used in the *tidyverse*.

**Tidy data**: Data that adheres or has been transformed to adhere to certain
standards that facilitate initial cleaning, and later exploration and analysis
of the data ([Tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)).

**Tidyverse**: a collection of R packages for operating on tabular data in
  consistent ways.

**Tidymodels**: a collection of R packages for modeling and statistical
analysis.

**Truthy**: A truly Orwellian neologism meaning "not equivalent to false". See
  also *falsy*, but only if you are able to set aside your respect for the
  English language.

**Unicode**: A standard that defines numeric codes for many thousands of
  characters and symbols. Unicode does not define how those numbers are stored;
  that is done by standards like *UTF-8*.

**Unit test**: A test that exercises one property or expected behavior of a
  system.

**UTF-8**: A way to store the numeric codes representing Unicode characters in
  memory that is *backward-compatible* with the older *ASCII* standard.

**Variable**: A name in a program that has some data associated with it. A
  variable's value can be changed after definition. See also *constant*.

**Variable arguments**: in a function, the ability to take any number of
  arguments.  R uses `...` to capture the "extra" arguments.

**Vector**: a sequence of values, usually of homogeneous* type.  Vectors are the
  fundamental data structure in R; *scalars* are actually vectors of unit
  length.

**Vectorize**: to write code so that operations are performed on entire vectors,
  rather than element-by-element within loops.

**Whitespace**: The space, newline, carriage return, and horizontal and vertical
  tab characters that take up space but don't create a visible mark.  The name
  comes from their appearance on a printed page in the era of typewriters.
